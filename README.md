# The Chosen One 2

## Guide

On start of the game you can choose difficulty level and number of players, when you are ready you can select start game option.
When selecting two players option you will be promted to select how many points players need to collect to win the game.

There are three platforms, your goal is to collect as many pink crosses as u can while avoiding green monsters ones.
When u jump on side platforms to collect pink cubes, you need to use portals on left and right side of the map to get back to middle platform.
Left portal will teleport you on left side of the middle platform, right portal will teleport you on right side of the middle platform.

It's pretty simple so i hope you enjoy the game.
